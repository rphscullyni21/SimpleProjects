# SimpleProjects
I decided to build a couple of smaller projects to keep me coding while not going full force into a bunch of big projects that are time consuming. These projects may only take me a couple hours to build (although I'd be willing to bet they'll take longer as I am still trying to get better) but just the same they're meant to help keep my interest up
