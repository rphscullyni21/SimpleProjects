# SimpleProjects
I decided to build a couple of smaller projects to keep me coding while not going full force into a bunch of big projects that are time consuming. These projects may only take me a couple hours to build (although I'd be willing to bet they'll take longer as I am still trying to get better) but just the same they're meant to help keep my interest up. They are intentionally designed for learning purposes and may have limited functionality. They are meant to demonstrate basic concepts and serve as starting points for further exploration.

## Projects

Here is a list of projects included in this repository:

1. **To-Do List**
   - This is a basic drop down, to do list with the ability to add and remove tasks. I considered adding in the ability to color code tasks as either 'not started' (orange), 'started' (light-yellow), or 'finished' (light-green) and I have that in my vs code folder for this project but I haven't finished tweaking it enough to push it to this repo.

2. **Random Quote Generator**
   - Create a web page that displays a random quote each time the user clicks the button.
3. ...

## Disclaimer
